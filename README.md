# delayed-discharges

At present, the file "Rmd_files/march22_onwards_NHSGGC-Delayed-Discharge-Bed-Days-Monthly-Performance-Report.Rmd" is being developed as the script that will be utilised to generate reports.  The associated script also being developed is "scripts/march22_funcs.R".

The report utilises the script "scripts/populations.R".  As, at the time of writing, the mid-year estimates of populations are up to the year 2020, the script copies the lastest year for 2021 and 2022.  When the mid-year estimates for 2021 become available, "scripts/populations.R" will need to be updated.
